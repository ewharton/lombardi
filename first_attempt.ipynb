    "possible question to ask: given probability distribution based on last 16 games, a player falls into one of those probability buckets on his next game. what was the probability they would fall into that bucket?\n",
    "\n",
    "what does this attempt at solving though? if they fall into higher probability buckets more frequently, which will confirm my hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "this is actually kind of difficult to even frame the question. we're not predicting anything. what if we compared cumulative versus 16 game performance and attempted to determine which was a better indicator of future performance?\n",

    "Then, are there certain weights we can apply to past performance that will improve the model?\n",
